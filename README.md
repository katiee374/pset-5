# PSET 5: Final Review & Adventure Project
## Part 1: Java Constructs Review
You will review the basics of Java, including variable declaration and operator
precedence.

## Part 2: Classes & Objects Review
You will review the necessary aspects of an object-defining class, and you will 
reflect on the purpose of object-oriented design.

## Part 3: Inheritance & Polymorphism Review
You will review inheritance and polymorphism, and you will practice with UML 
diagrams.

## Part 4: Recursion Review
You will review the purpose of recursion and how recursive methods compare to 
iterative methods. Recursion can be tricky, so be sure to get plenty of  
practice writing recursive methods before the final!

## Part 5: GUI Review
You will briefly review concepts from the GUI unit.

## Part 6: Finalizing the Adventure Game
In this part of the adventure game project, you will put the finishing touches 
on your game. It is worth noting that there are many extensions you can make 
to your game, including adding a GUI component, after the course is over. If 
you'd like some suggestions on how to continue with the project, contact an 
instructor or TA. For now, you will simply extend your parsing of commands to 
understand more words. Follow the instructions in Parser.java. When you're 
done, upload the updated files to this repository.
